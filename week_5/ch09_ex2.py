# Write a Python program that uses a for-loop to print all
# integers between 300 and 600 (inclusive) that are divisible
# by both 3 and 5. Print how many of these numbers were
# found
















# alternative solution
# count = 0
# for number in range(300, 600+1):
#     if (number % 3 == 0) and (number % 5 == 0):
#         print(number)
#         count += 1
# print(f"{count} numbers found")
